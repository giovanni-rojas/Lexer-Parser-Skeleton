Issues:

6.bad.lang results in "error at line 53", whereas the expected result is "error at line 55".

7.bad.lang has an issue with 'while 171 { }', in which it doesn't see an error at all.

Similarly, 8.bad.lang has an issue with the 'if true or false { } else {' in which it also doesn't see an error.
